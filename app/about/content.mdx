Hi, nice to meet you!
I am Janki, a Bay Area-based product designer with a technical background focused on machine learning. Born and raised in India with a rich cultural upbringing, I aim to bring the best of my worlds into my colorful, bold, and detail-oriented designs.

My passion for design led me to pursue a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Maryland, College Park. I am currently designing functional and intuitive experiences for emerging technologies within Juniper Networks for their cloud-native applications. At Juniper Networks, I have worked on various projects in enterprise cloud-native software like network visualization, telemetry, machine learning, and data centers. I have also worked on projects to build a reusable Figma component library and improve the company-wide design system to make it accessible and inclusive.

Outside of work, you can find me painting digital landscapes, listening to audiobooks, binge-watching period dramas, or learning new languages (currently: French). I also discovered baking during the pandemic, and so far, I haven't burned the kitchen down. :P

Thanks for stopping by!
